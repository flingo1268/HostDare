## 1. Website Creation Platform: Wix

While there are many website platforms out there like Squarespace and WordPress, Iâ€™ve found success with **Wix**. Its drag-and-drop editor is beginner-friendly, affordable, and incredibly easy to use. The **Unlimited Plan**, which costs $12.50/month (billed annually), is perfect for creating professional websites.

### Why Choose Wix?

- Access customizable industry-specific templates.
- Handle hosting and updates seamlessly.

No matter your experience level, Wix ensures your website looks polished and professional.

Email marketing is essential for growing your business. Depending on your needs, I recommend **MailChimp** for beginners or **ConvertKit** for advanced automation.

- Customizable newsletters with a drag-and-drop editor.

### ConvertKit:
- $29/month for the first 1,000 subscribers.
- Perfect for automated email sequences and subscriber tagging.

Choose MailChimp if you're just starting out or ConvertKit for scalable email marketing.
