## Key Features of Leadpages

While Leadpages is primarily known as a landing page builder, its diverse features make it much more than that. With tools ranging from tested templates to advanced integrations, Leadpages can help elevate your digital marketing campaigns.

### High-Converting Templates

Leadpages provides a library of **mobile-friendly templates** optimized for conversions. These templates are easy to customize, allowing you to tailor them to your brand without any coding skills. Simply drag and drop elements to create a professional landing page that fits your campaign goals. If you don't have a website, Leadpages can host your landing pages for you, making it a flexible option for marketers at any stage.

### LeadBoxes for Optimized Lead Generation

One standout feature is **LeadBoxes**, which are pop-ups designed to capture leads at the right moment. These pop-ups can:
- Trigger when a user clicks a button, text, or image.
- Appear after a visitor spends a set amount of time on your site.
- Display as exit-intent pop-ups to retain visitors about to leave your page.

This functionality helps maximize your lead generation potential with minimal effort.

### Built-In Ad Creation

Leadpages simplifies your marketing efforts by allowing you to create **Facebook and Instagram ads** directly within the platform. The software automatically pulls content from your landing page, enabling you to edit and publish ads quickly. With Leadpagesâ€™ integration with Facebook Pixel, you can also retarget your visitors and access advanced analytics to refine your campaigns.

### A/B Testing for Better Conversions

The **split testing feature** lets you test variations of your landing pages to identify what works best. Experiment with different headlines, layouts, or CTAs to optimize your page for higher conversion rates. The data-driven insights provided by Leadpagesâ€™ A/B testing tool take the guesswork out of your marketing strategy.

### Seamless Integrations

Leadpages integrates with numerous third-party tools to create a seamless marketing experience. Some popular integrations include:
